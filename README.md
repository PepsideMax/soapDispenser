# soapDispenser
making a touchless soap dispenser usring an esp32 and blynk cloud

so this project zqs just more as a reminder to myself becous often after sneezing i forget to wash my hands. So I installed a simple microphone module on a esp32 so just give me a reminder for when I do sneeze. after a while it just got teadeus so i thougth well why not just add a soap dispenser to the project to make my life easyer I still had a sharp 2Y0A21 and just had to order a small pump online while i was still waiting on this pump i could already test using a small fan instead.
